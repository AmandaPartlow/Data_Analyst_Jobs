### Nashville Software School Group Project - Using SQL for Basic SQL Exploration

This project served as an introduction to SQL. We were asked some basic questions about the data, which was derived from the [Indeed Data Scientist/Analyst/Engineer dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/elroyggj/indeed-dataset-data-scientistanalystengineer) on kaggle.com. Some questions included "How many postings in Tennessee have a star rating above 4?" and "How many different job titles do not contain either the word ‘Analyst’ or the word ‘Analytics’? What word do these positions have in common?"
